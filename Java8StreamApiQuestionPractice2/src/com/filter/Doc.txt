			FlatMap()
			=========

flatMap() is an intermediate Stream operation used when:

		-- Each element contains multiple values
		-- You want to flatten nested collections
		-- Output elements should be in one single stream
Note --> It is used for one-to-many mapping.

	When do we use flatMap()?

	 ->Reading file → each line split into words
	 ->List<List<String>> to List<String>
